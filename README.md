1. Dataset can be downloaded from the link provided in the dataset_linl.txt file
2. The file's name is "MachineLearningCSV.zip"
3. The file size is around 220 MB before extraction and around 840 MB post extraction
4. After placing the notebook and the dataset fiel in the same directory, the notebook can be then used to train based on the data.
5. Users might run into kernel crash errors because of high RAM usage while executing the third block. They are advised to down sample the data if that happens.
6. The trained model file has also been uploaded if you wish to directly use the model.
